                Yes, there really was an Ann Sather.
            </p>

            <p className={paragraphClass}>
                In the 1940s, a vivacious career woman named Ann Sather decided that what she really wanted to do was
                own and run a restaurant. Her restaurant. A place where people could come for generous homemade meals,
                warm hospitality and know the moment they came in the door they went from being a customer to becoming a
                friend.

                <p className={paragraphClass}>
                    So, in 1945, when the Swedish owners of a restaurant located on Belmont decided to retire, Ann
                    quit her job of 22 years, pooled her life savings and bought herself a diner known today as Ann
                    Sather Restaurant.
                </p>

                <p className={paragraphClass}>
                    For 35 years Ann ran the diner herself. Her devotion to wholesome, made-from-scratch food, low
                    prices, friendly service and hard work became legendary in the Lakeview neighborhood and beyond.
                </p>

                <br />
                <p className={paragraphClass}>
                    In 1981, after searching for a successor who would meet her stringent demands for quality and
                    remain devoted to her patrons, Ann sold the restaurant to Tom Tunney, a 24-year-old graduate of
                    the Cornell University School of Hotel and Restaurant Management. Tom apprenticed with Ann for a
                    year learning the business from top to bottom. Armed with culinary training, Tom, the son of
                    Irish immigrants who grew up on Chicago’s Southside, was learning all of the best Scandinavian
                    cooking secrets in town.

                <br />
                <p className={paragraphClass}>
                    Although Ann Sather sadly passed away in 1996, her spirit still prevails in the “good food, good
                    friends and good conversation” philosophy that has made her restaurants famous. She still looks
                    over us all from her portrait hanging in the dining room.
                </p>

                <br />
                <p className={paragraphClass}>
                    During the last 35 years, Tom has expanded the business to include the most famous cinnamon rolls
                    and breakfast in town, two additional restaurants and Ann Sather Corporate and Special Event
                    Catering, which is well-known for its corporate and special events, banquets, business breakfasts
                    and lunches and special deliveries.

                    only serves good food, but also serves the 44th Ward as its Alderman. But even with his busy
                    schedule, Tom is the heart of the Ann Sather family, so don’t be surprised to have him greet you
                    at the door or find him cooking breakfast orders on Sundays.
